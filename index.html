			<p>So you want to throw a party? Well, my friend, you have come to the right place. 
		In my brief, yet detailed guide, you will learn that it is the small things that create a fun and eventful atmosphere. We will cover details
		regarding all party types whether they be outside summertime B.B.Q.s, or inside wine nights with your closest of friends. Parties are meant 
		to bring people and good times together. Let the good times roll!</p>

		<center><h2>Budget</h2></center>
		
			<p> Before making any sort of decisions regarding details about your party, you need to create a budget. A budget will
			dictate the parameters of just how pimped out your party will be. Although, with that said, a great party can happen with even
			the most frugal of budgets.</p>

	<p>Obviously there can be multiple variations of budgets and allocations of money, but a rule to stick to 
	is to make sure to invest a good amount towards <i>food</i>.
</div>
<h3>Food</h3>
	<p> Food is what draws people together. Not only does it nourish the body, but it nourishes souls through its flavors,
	colors, and meanings. Sure even if you order pizza for your son's soccer party, it creates memories like how many slices
	your son and his teammates ate. But also in many cases, food is a love language. Making food even depends to the love.
	I could write a whole paper on the importance of food at a party, but for the sake of this quick guide, I will keep
	it short and sweet: food is important. Below I will list food ideas for a variety of events.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Kid's Soccer Party- pizza, burger & hot dog bar, veggie tray.</li>
	<li>Wine Night- Wine, meat and cheese board, light salad, chocolate strawberries. </li>
	<li>Football Party- wings, dips, meatballs, pigs 'n a blanket, cupcakes.</li>
	<li>Business Dinner- bruschetta, caprese salad, roast chicken, brussel sprouts, salad, chocolate cake.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h4>Decor</h4>
	<p>Now that we have budget and food figured out, lets spruce up your soriee. I like use what
	is in my back yard to see if there is any greenery or florals available. Live decor truly does spruce up a room. If you
	can not attain such elements, no need to worry. Any part store, or even dollar stores, have perfect options. Just remember
	color is great all within the limits of the theme. Ultimately the decor is a reflection on your style and the tone
	you want to set for the party. So just have fun with it! Below I will leave a link of my favorite party supply company.</p>
